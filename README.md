R package "cellcount" for cell enumeration using fluorescent microscopy

The ***cellcount*** package provides a simple an automated approach to quantifying bacteria and cyanobacteria *via* flourescence microscopy. Cyanobacteria enumeration is an important tool to incorporate data results into mathematical models to assess bloom dynamics. However, standard manual cyanobacteria enumeration is considered time-consuming and can impact overall random error due to different inaccuracies from researcher to researcher. Here, we outline a new open-source tool, ***cellcount***, a package designed for the computing language R to assist with cyanobacteria enumeration. Fluorescent microscopy images are analyzed by this package to generate cyanobacteria counts to assess overall cell density from samples.

Please refer to the *"cellcount_intro"* documentation to learn more about the package and how this tool can apply to your research.
