image_convert2(
  x,
  w = 17,
  h = 17,
  offset = 0.001,
  areathresh = 50,

\arguments{
\item{x}{an image variable that has been mapped using the "mapped" function}

\item{w}{width of the moving rectangular window (see EBImage)}

\item{h}{heigth of the moving rectangular window (see EBImage)}

\item{offset}{a thresholding offset}

\item{areathresh}{a numerical value regarding the individual pixel areas of cells within each image - this sets a threshold for what items are removed from images}

\item{tolerance}{The minimum height of the object in the units of image intensity between its highest point and the point where it contacts another object (see EBImage)}

\item{ext}{Radius of the neighborhood in pixels for the detection of neighboring objects. Higher values smooth out small objects (see EBImage for more details)}
}
\value{
Produces the proper data format for the function "countImages" to produce color-label images.
}
\description{
Takes a mapped image (i.e., data matrix) and counts individual cells within an image.
This is to be used with images that contains a single
fluorescent dimension of cells. Best used for filamentous/colonial-cell type images.
images. See "image_convert" regarding images with single-cells.
